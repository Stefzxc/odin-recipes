    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>While this claims to be an exquisite recipe, in reality I am a man of much laziness and therefore instead of using any significant effort in the creation of a grilled cheese I have devised a method by which the most passable grilled cheese can be cooked with bare minimum effort. This methodology is adaptable to a wide variety of ingredient qualities but I would still recommend using somewhat above bottom tier materials in the hope that this will counterbalance your personal lack of effort.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>   
    <ul>
        <li>Bread (may be of any variety), at least 2 slices</li>
        <li>Butter, preferable over oil, ideally non-spreadable</li>
        <li>Cheese, your choice but I would recommend an extra mature or vintage cheddar</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut your cheese(s, cheesi?) of choice into relatively thin slices</li>
        <li>Thinly spread a small amount of butter onto one side of each slice of bread and lightly toast them in a pan for 1-2 minutes</li>
        <li>Once your bread is lightly brown from the toasting take it off of the pan and spread butter on the side that is not toasted</li>
        <li>Place cheese on top of once slice with the toasted side facing up until satisfied with the quantity and place the other slice on top with the toasted side facing down</li>
        <li>Place your grilled cheese back onto the pan until one side is toasted and flip for the other side as well</li>
        <li>Take your grilled cheese, plate it, and cut it dramatically in an attempt to show off the cheese pull for your instagram followers</li>
    </ol>
